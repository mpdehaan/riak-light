= riak_light

* http://github.com/mpdehaan/riak-light

== DESCRIPTION:

An extra lightweight Ruby binding for Riak that has less dependencies
than ripple.  

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

It works for basic storage and access.

* Otherwise, very minimal functionality at this point
* does not understand links and tags
* errors often come back as HTTPErrors rather than something translated
* no attempt to resolve vector clock collisions

== SYNOPSIS:

riak = RiakLight.new()
puts riak.bucket_info("llamas").inspect()
puts riak.bucket_add("llamas", "bob", { "says" => "I'm not a llama" }).inspect()
(obj, vclock) = riak.bucket_get("llamas", "bob")
puts obj.inspect()
# attempt to re-add
puts riak.bucket_add("llamas", "bob", { "says" => "I'm not a llama" }).inspect()
puts obj.vclock()
(obj, vclock) = riak.bucket_get("llamas", "steve")
